# 🌀 Blender Projects

This repository serves as a curated collection of my work created using **Blender**, an open-source 3D creation suite.  
It contains a variety of projects demonstrating skills in **3D modeling, texturing, animation, and simulation**.  
Each folder corresponds to an individual project and includes the associated `.blend` files, textures, and supporting assets.  
The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey, showcase completed projects, and provide a structured archive of experiments and creative works in Blender.

## ⚡ Notes

- Large files (`.blend`, `.blend1`, `.tif`) are tracked using **Git LFS**.  
- Render outputs (images, videos) are excluded via `.gitignore`.  
- This repo focuses on **learning, experimentation, and showcasing Blender capabilities**.

3. Open any .blend file in Blender.

## 📖 Learning Journey
These projects are part of my journey to master Blender.
They include both beginner tutorials (like the Donut) and self-made projects (like Smoke, Stormy Ocean, and Coffee Scene).
